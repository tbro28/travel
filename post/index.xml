      <description>The whole establishment is decked out. Lots of vehicles outside and tons of guns inside to look at with LOTS of DO NOT TOUCH signs :( But I want one!

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t always drink wine, but when I do it&amp;rsquo;s on a wine train in Napa Valley!
Yes, you can lean out of the windows for footage. Hopefully you enjoy looking at grapes, because the scale of grapes growing is vast and impressive.

I actually don&amp;rsquo;t recall taking this video. Perhaps it was after my train tour and I was a little tipsy. Like they say, &amp;ldquo;when in Rome!&amp;rdquo; That might also explain why I&amp;rsquo;m standing on the track unable to see whether a train is coming in the opposite direction about to take me out.</description>

      <description>With all of the heigh stuff I have done in the past, along with going to the Stratosphere after this I thought it might not be fun, but it was a blast. Just a short blast, but something to do in the Fremont area of Vegas.

      <description>After 9 years of living in Seattle I thought I had seen the whole city. I was wrong. This company took off from Boeing field and I assume most of them do, since it is so close to Seattle.

      <description>For being way higher than the bungee jumps that I’ve done, this really wasn’t bad at all. It’s a nice almost “gentle” fall to the ground below.

      <description>Playing in the clouds on a mountain covered with snow.
This is heading down the lower part of Alpine at Summit Central.
If there is one positive of all the rain in the northwest this is it.

      <description>It’s a shame that this place no longer exists. I believe the tower is still there, but hasn&amp;rsquo;t been operational for a long time.

      <description>Clouds couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop a good time.
The video is mostly west of the Newburg dock. Wakeboarding behind a ski boat with no ballast tanks; I&amp;rsquo;ll still take it! Any way to get out on the water is a good one. We used to put hundreds of pounds of sand bags in the back for a little more wake :) I&amp;rsquo;d definitely use fatsacs nowadays even if it meant being a little cramped.</description>
