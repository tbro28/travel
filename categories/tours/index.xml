      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t always drink wine, but when I do it&amp;rsquo;s on a wine train in Napa Valley!
Yes, you can lean out of the windows for footage. Hopefully you enjoy looking at grapes, because the scale of grapes growing is vast and impressive.

I actually don&amp;rsquo;t recall taking this video. Perhaps it was after my train tour and I was a little tipsy. Like they say, &amp;ldquo;when in Rome!&amp;rdquo; That might also explain why I&amp;rsquo;m standing on the track unable to see whether a train is coming in the opposite direction about to take me out.</description>

      <description>After 9 years of living in Seattle I thought I had seen the whole city. I was wrong. This company took off from Boeing field and I assume most of them do, since it is so close to Seattle.

      <description>These were way easier and way more fun to ride than I had expected. Of course it rained on us towards the end.
